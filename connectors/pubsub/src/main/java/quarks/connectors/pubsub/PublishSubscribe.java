/**
 * Publish subscribe model.
 * <BR>
 * A stream can be {@link #publish(TStream, String, Class) published } to a topic
 * and then {@link #subscribe(TopologyElement, String, Class) subscribed} to by
 * other topologies.
 * 
 * <P>
 * A published topic has a type and subscribers must subscribe using the same
 * topic and type (inheritance matching is not supported).
 * <BR>
 * Multiple streams from different topologies can be published to
 * same topic (and type) and there can be multiple subscribers
 * from different topologies.
 * <BR>
 * A subscriber can exist before a publisher exists, they are connected
 * automatically when the job starts.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * If no {@link PublishSubscribeService} is registered then published
 * tuples are discarded and subscribers see no tuples.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * The recommended style for topics is MQTT topics, where {@code /}
 * is used to provide a hierarchy into topics. For example {@code engine/sensors/temperature}
 * might be a topic that represents temperature sensors in an engine.
 * <BR>
 * Topics that start with {@code quarks/} are reserved for use by Quarks.
 * <BR>
 * MQTT style wild-cards are not supported.
 * </P>
