 * Partitioned window of tuples. Logically a window
 * represents an continuously updated ordered list of tuples according to the
 * criteria that created it. For example {@link TStream#last(int, Function) s.last(10, zero())}
 * declares a window with a single partition that at any time contains the last ten tuples seen on
 * stream {@code s}.
 * <P>
 * Windows are partitioned which means the window's configuration
 * is independently maintained for each key seen on the stream.
 * For example with a window created using {@link TStream#last(int, Function) last(3, tuple -> tuple.getId())}
 * then each key has its own window containing the last
 * three tuples with the same key obtained from the tuple's identity using {@code getId()}.
